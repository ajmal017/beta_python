<h2>USE OF THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz and Advisor may use third party service providers to assist in providing certain Services with or without notice to you (each, a "Third Party Service Provider"). BetaSmartz or your Advisor may also change Third Party Service Providers or may provide a Service without the assistance of such third party. You consent and authorize BetaSmartz and your Advisor to delegate the authorizations you provide to us to Third Party Service Provider(s) as we deem necessary or desirable to provide the applicable Service to you. You agree that the terms and conditions of the OSA, including any of the other terms, conditions, warranty disclaimers and liability disclaimers incorporated into this OSA, inure to the benefit of such Third Party Service Providers and such Third Party Service Providers are deemed to be third party beneficiaries of the OSA, including any other terms, conditions, warranty disclaimers and liability disclaimers incorporated into this OSA.

You agree to waive all claims resulting from failure to receive communications because of changes in your e-mail or U.S. mail address. From time to time, we would like to send you information about BetaSmartz products and services. If you open an account, you are granting BetaSmartz and your Advisor permission to communicate with you by e-mail. You can opt not to receive such information from BetaSmartz in the future by following the instructions in any e-mail that BetaSmartz sends to you.</p>

<p>You agree to be bound by any affirmation, assent, or agreement you transmit through the Services you access by computer or other electronic device, including internet, telephonic and wireless devices, including but not limited to any consent you give to receive communications from us solely through electronic transmission. You agree that, when in the future you click on an "I agree," "I consent" or other similarly worded "button" or entry field with your mouse, keystroke or other device, your agreement or consent will be legally binding and enforceable and the legal equivalent of your handwritten signature.</p>


<h2>USE OF SERVICES</h2>

<p>The following requirements apply to your use of all Services: </p>

<ul>
  <li>You will not use any electronic communication feature of a Service for any purpose that is unlawful, tortious, abusive, intrusive on another's privacy, harassing, libelous, defamatory, embarrassing, obscene, threatening or hateful.</li>
  <li>You will not upload, post, reproduce or distribute any information, software or other material protected by copyright or any other intellectual property right (as well as rights of publicity and privacy) without first obtaining the permission of the owner of such rights.</li>

</ul>


<h2>MARKET INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We may make available to you through one or more Services a broad range of financial information that we obtain from Third Party Service Providers. This includes financial market data, quotes, news, analyst opinions, and research reports and further includes any third-party model portfolios. Collectively, we refer to this as "Market Information." BetaSmartz and your Advisor do not endorse or approve Market Information, and we make it available to you only as a service and convenience. BetaSmartz, your Advisor, and our Third Party Service Providers do not (1) guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or correct sequencing of Market Information, or (2) warrant any results from your use or reliance on Market Information. Market Information may quickly become unreliable for various reasons including, for example, changes in market conditions or economic circumstances. Neither BetaSmartz, your Advisor, nor the Third Party Service Providers are obligated to update any information or opinions contained in any Market Information, and we may discontinue offering Market Information at any time without notice. You agree that neither BetaSmartz, your Advisor, the Partcipating Broker-Dealer nor the Third Party Service Providers will be liable to you in any way for the termination, interruption, delay, or inaccuracy of any Market Information. You will not redistribute or facilitate the redistribution of Market Information, nor will you provide access to Market Information to anyone who is not authorized by BetaSmartz or your Advisor to receive Market Information. If you are a securities broker, dealer, banker, or investment advisor, you agree not to use Market Information for any purpose related to your business.</p>


<h2>NO INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM BETASMARTZ</h2>

<p>The BetaSmartz Services and content (including the online interface) are distinct from the advice and Advisor Services your Advisor provides. Although BetaSmartz Services may provide information relating to investment approaches and opportunities to buy or sell securities, this investment advice has been prepared for you by your Advisor. You should not construe any Market Information, features, whitepapers, tools or other content available through any Service as legal, tax, investment, financial or other advice from BetaSmartz. Nothing contained in any Service or any other content on the Site constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by BetaSmartz or a Third Party Service Provider to buy or sell any securities or other financial instruments.</p>

<p>Your access to the Site is exclusively through your Advisor. Your Advisor and you are solely responsible, and BetaSmartz is not responsible, for choosing an investment strategy, determining the appropriateness of the chosen investment strategy for your investment needs and goals, and taking the steps to become invested in your selected investment strategy. Your Advisor is independent of and not owned by, affiliated with or supervised by BetaSmartz. Any fee you pay your Advisor is not set or supervised by BetaSmartz.</p>


<h2>USE OF ACCESS DEVICES</h2>

<p>With the exception of applications commonly known as Web Browser software, or other applications formally promoted, endorsed or approved by BetaSmartz in writing, you agree not to use any software, program, application or any other device to access or log on to any Service, including BetaSmartz’s or your Advisor's computer systems, Site or proprietary software or to automate the process of obtaining, downloading, transferring or transmitting any Market Information or any other content to or from any Service, including BetaSmartz’s or your Advisor's computer systems, the Site or proprietary software.</p>


<h2>DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz and/or its employees or directors as well as its affiliates, consultants, your Advisor, and Third Party Service Providers may have clients with positions in securities or companies referenced in Market Information and may, as principal or agent, buy from or sell to customers. From time to time, BetaSmartz, your Advisor or a Third Party Service Provider may be unable to provide Market Information with respect to certain companies with which BetaSmartz or the Third Party Service Provider or their affiliates have certain business relationships.</p>


<h2>SECURITY OF DATA TRANSMISSIONS AND STORAGE</h2>

<p>Electronic (including wired and wireless) communications through the Services may not be encrypted. You acknowledge that there is a risk that data, including e-mail, electronic and wireless communications and personal data, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated between you and BetaSmartz or between you and your Advisor.</p>


<h2>MONITORING</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz, its affiliates and agents and your Advisor are entitled, but not obligated, to review or retain your Communications. We and our Third Party Service Providers may monitor your Communications to evaluate the quality of service you receive, your compliance with the OSA, the security of the Services, or for other reasons. You agree that these monitoring activities will not entitle you to any cause of action or other right with respect to the manner in which BetaSmartz, its Third Party Service Providers, or your Advisor monitor your Communications and enforce or fail to enforce the Rules and Guidelines of any Service and the terms of the OSA. In no event will BetaSmartz, its Third Party Service Providers, the Participating Broker-Dealer or your Advisor be liable for any costs, damages, expenses or any other liabilities incurred by you as a result of any monitoring activities.</p>


<h2>HYPERLINKS</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz may provide a link from the Site to your Advisor's site on the Internet for your convenience. This site is maintained by your Advisor, and BetaSmartz exercises no control over the site. BetaSmartz does not endorse or sponsor such web sites, and is not affiliated with your Advisor. Accordingly BetaSmartz expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, the accuracy of the information, and the availability of and/or quality of products or services provided by or advertised on your Advisor's site.</p>

<p>We may make available links from the Site to other, third party sites or electronic services providers that are not affiliated with us. BetaSmartz and your Advisor do not control these other sites or services, and BetaSmartz makes no representations or endorsements whatsoever concerning those sites or services. The fact that we have provided a link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation with respect to such site, its owners, or its providers. There are risks in using any information, software, service or product found on the Internet, and BetaSmartz and your Advisor caution you to make sure you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. You agree that under no circumstances will you hold BetaSmartz or your Advisor liable for any loss or damage caused by use of or reliance on any content, goods or services available on other sites.</p>


<h2>PRIVACY ONLINE</h2>

<p>When you interact with BetaSmartz through the Site, BetaSmartz handles personal information in accordance with the practices and safeguards described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are bits of data that a website sends to a web browser on a visitor's computer. Cookies help us to collect information about you and other visitors to the Site, including date and time of visit, pages viewed, amount of time spent on our sites, or general information about the device used to access the site. Cookies are also used for security purposes and to personalize your experience, such as customizing your screen layout.</p>

<p>You can refuse or delete cookies. Most browsers and mobile devices offer their own settings to manage cookies. If you refuse a cookie when on the Site, or if you delete cookies, you may lose functionality. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences.</p>

<h2>HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>

<p>Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the Site. BetaSmartz engages in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting" or “tracking”), through which information collected about the pages you visit on BetaSmartz is used to display ads for BetaSmartz products or services on third-party websites. This information may uniquely identify a browser but is not personally identifiable.</p>


<h2>ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz may use third-party online advertising companies to provide you with BetaSmartz advertisements that may be relevant to your interests, as determined by your activity on BetaSmartz and non-BetaSmartz websites. This type of ad customization is known as "online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. These advertising companies may use cookies to understand your interests based on, for example, pages visited and browsing patterns on BetaSmartz and non-BetaSmartz websites.</p>


<h2>DATA SECURITY ONLINE</h2>

<p>To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES</h2>

BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE. THE SITE, SERVICES, AND INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS OF THE INFORMATION, TEXT, GRAPHICS, LINKS OR OTHER ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES. BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR PROVIDE NO GUARANTEE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA. BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE SITE AND SERVICES, OR THE MISUSE OR MISINTERPRETATION OF, ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES. BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR MAY CHANGE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME AND MAKE NO COMMITMENT TO UPDATE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES, SITE, AND INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.</p>

<p>FURTHER, BETASMARTZ AND YOUR ADVISOR MAKE NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES OR SITE. BETASMARTZ AND ITS AFFILIATES AND AGENTS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) AND YOUR ADVISOR DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</p>

<p>ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BETASMARTZ OR YOUR ADVISOR OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>


<h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

<p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD BETASMARTZ AND ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND LICENSORS (INCLUDING THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS), THE PARTCIPATING BROKER-DEALER AND YOUR ADVISOR HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, LOSS, COSTS OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, MADE BY ANY PERSON ARISING OUT OF YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS OSA, STATE OR FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S RIGHTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INFRINGEMENT OF ANY COPYRIGHT OR VIOLATION OF ANY PROPRIETARY OR PRIVACY RIGHT.</p>

<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A NEGLIGENT ACT, WILL BETASMARTZ OR ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR LICENSORS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS), THE PARTCIPATING BROKER-DEALER AND YOUR ADVISOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, ANY SERVICE OR SITE, EVEN IF ANY SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL BETASMARTZ OR ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, THE PARTCIPATING BROKER-DEALER OR YOUR ADVISOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY TORT, CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF A SERVICE OR SITE, OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY BETASMARTZ OR YOUR ADVISOR. BETASMARTZ AND ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND YOUR ADVISOR WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU AND/OR ANY THIRD PARTY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF BETASMARTZ OR ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR YOUR ADVISOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES RESULTING FROM: (i) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR SITE; (ii) THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MISDELIVERY, OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY USER DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS; (iii) THE COST OF GETTING SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES; (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (v) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANYONE ON THE SERVICES OR SITE; (vi) THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THE THIRD PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED PREVIOUSLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; OR (vii) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT IN ANY WAY HOLD BETASMARTZ RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SELECTION OR RETENTION OF, OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF, THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR SITE.</p>

<p>Because some states prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to you, and the respective liability of BetaSmartz and its Third Party Service Providers, employees, distributors and agents and your Advisor is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states.</p>

<p>In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liabilities or remedies available as set forth in this OSA, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of your remedies under this OSA fail, then you expressly agree that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of BetaSmartz and its Third Party Service Providers, employees, distributors, agents or affiliates, and your Advisor to you or any party claiming by or through you for any cause whatsoever, exceed $100 (U.S.), regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.</p>

<p>All references to "BetaSmartz" in this section shall include BetaSmartz’s affiliates and business units, including but not limited to BetaSmartz Advisory LLC.</p>


<h2>RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h2>

<h2>MODIFICATIONS, SUSPENSIONS AND TERMINATIONS OF SERVICES</h2>

<p>BetaSmartz and your Advisor reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, a Service or the Site (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that BetaSmartz and your Advisor will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of a Service or Site. Please keep in mind that extended periods of inactivity may also result in your enrollment in a Service being canceled. The license granted under the OSA will terminate if BetaSmartz or your Advisor believes that any information provided by you, including your e-mail address, is no longer current or accurate, or if you fail to otherwise comply with any term or condition of the OSA and all Rules and Guidelines for each Service. Upon such violation, you agree to terminate access to the Services.</p>


<h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>

<p>The OSA, and all future agreements you may enter into with BetaSmartz, unless otherwise indicated on such other agreement, will be governed by the law of the state of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof. This is the case regardless of whether you reside or transact business with BetaSmartz or your Advisor in New York or elsewhere. Unless a dispute would be governed by an applicable arbitration clause, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the City of New York, New York. If any part of the OSA is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
