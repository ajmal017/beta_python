        <p>We are here to help you achieve your retirement dreams.</p>
        <p>Thank you for the opportunity to help you plan your retirement and get you on track for the future.</p>
        <p>We're pleased to provide your Retirement Plan Statement of Advice (SOA), which details our advice. This document will help you understand how you're placed to meet your dream retirement outcome.</p>
        <p>In preparing this document we have taken into account the information you provided, together with your financial situation, needs and goals. In particular you told us that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            {{client.first_name}}, you want to retire at {{plan.retirement_age}}
            {% if has_partner %} and {{partner_name}}, you want to retire at {{plan.partner_data.retirement_age}}{% endif %}.
          </li>
          <li>
            At retirement you want to start using your retirement savings as income.
          </li>
          <li>
            You want to know how long your money will last through retirement.
          </li>
          <li>
            You want to know what type of lifestyle youâ€™ll have in retirement.
          </li>

        <h3>Dream</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40pt;">
          It all starts with a dream<br />
          for life after work. We'll<br />
          talk to members first<br />
          about where they want to<br />
          be so we can find the<br />
          best way to get them
          there.
        </p>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40pt;">
          Dreams without a plan are<br />
          just wishes. Your unique<br />
          retirement dreams need a<br />
          plan that's made just for<br />
          them - a personal, ongoing<br />
          plan that changes as their<br />
          life does.
        </p>
        <h3>Achieve</h3>
        <p>
          Success doesn't happen<br />
          by chance. A watchful eye<br />
          and dependable support<br />
          can help get you where<br />
          you want to be.
