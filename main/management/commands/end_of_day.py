    Transaction Cost Ratio (TCR)
    - The ratio of the size of the transaction vs the costs involved.

    Automatic Transaction Cost Threshold (ATCS)
    - The limit of TCR, below which an automatic transaction will not be performed.

    Overnight Process
    - Download New Data
    - Clear redis instruments cache and recalculate for the day, setting a 4 day timeout to cover weekends/holidays.
    - Calculate the new markowitz lambda bounds.
    - Process any position adjustments from market fills
        - update the Position model and the Execution/ExecutionDistribution/Transaction models accordingly
    - Process any external transfers that were executed in or out from each account.
    - daily_balance
    - Measure all metrics on goals
      - This calculates drift
    - For every account, build a map of goal.id -> experimental_settings, which will be populated for each goal that has a
      change.
      - Process any market changes needed because of the new asset weights.
      - Process Pending Deposits/withdrawals.
        - Any pending deposit gets transferred from the account.cash_balance to the goal_cash_balance.
        - All Netted transactions get moved to 'executed'.
        - Any net withdrawal gets created as a new withdrawal if it doesn't match exactly a current pending withdrawal.
      - Build a list of Execution Requests for each goal based on a rebalance and tax loss harvest for each goal.
      - Confirming any execution requests:
        - Build a market order.
        - Determine cost of order
        - If ATCS is not met, don't send to market. Notify User/Advisor somehow.
        - Depending if the customer is fully managed or not, we may need to put the new market positions into a 'pending'
          state and confirm the rebalance. Confirming rebalances should be a selectable feature per account either way.
          - If position adjustments and existing 'pending' market position change, drop existing pending change.

     - Once the nightly process is done, compare the markowitz cost of the resulting portfolio against the daily optimum
       for this goal. This is the optimisation_drift. If it's over some percent different,
       inform the Client and Advisor that the portfolio needs to be reoptimised.
     - Inform client and advisor if a goal has expired.

    ===========================================================================

    Advisor/ Client Rebalance confirmation
    - We need to indicate to the Client/Advisor:
      - which rebalances need extra cash,
      - which ones went through (and what was the cost)
      -
